# manipal-wordle
This is a project developed by me and my team for a web development lab in my 6th semester. It emulates the popular game, Wordle, with a unique twist to the students of Manipal Institute of Technology. It is fundamentally made using Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

Kindly check the documentation report to get a complete idea of how the project works.

NOTE : All the images have to be moved from /locations into /build 
IMPORTANT : A live server has to be initiated from /build in order to enable the .js files
