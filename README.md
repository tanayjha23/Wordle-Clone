# Wordle-Clone-
This is a project that my team and I developed as a lab project in our sixth semester. It emulates the popular game-Wordle, with a unique twist for the students of Manipal Institute of Technology. It is fundamentally made using Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

Kindly check the documentation report to get a complete idea of how the project works.

NOTE : All the images have to be moved from /locations into /build IMPORTANT : A live server has to be initiated from /build in order to enable the .js files.
